            <h5> INTRODUCTION
          </h5></div><div class="widget-content"><div class="widget-box"><form class="well"><div class="controls"><p>Dear Parent,</p>
                  <p>We invite you to complete the Autism Research Institute’s (ARI) online questionnaire.   Autism is a heterogeneous condition, and we hope the results from this questionnaire will provide insight into understanding and treating those on the autism spectrum.</p>
                  <p>Background.  The questionnaire is actually a revised version of ARI’s Diagnostic Checklist Form E-2.  As many of you may know, Dr. Bernard Rimland, autism pioneer and founder of ARI, developed the checklist in the 1960s.  The first version, E-1, appeared as an appendix in his seminal 1964 book Infantile Autism: The Syndrome and Its Implications for a Neural Theory of Behavior.   Soon after the publication of the book, parents wrote to Dr. Rimland to share their own child’s developmental history along with descriptions of their behaviors; within a year or two, Dr. Rimland revised the checklist.  This year we added more questions to the E-2 because much has been learned over the past 50 years.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Rimland created the E-2 checklist to diagnose classical autism, or Kanner’s syndrome, as well as to subtype autism.  Over 42,000 parents worldwide have completed the E-2 checklist, and we recently analyzed the data in relation to subgroups.  The tentative findings indicate that there may be 10 to 12 types of autism. As with any research study, of course, these results need to be replicated. </p>
                  <p>We have been in communication with other researchers who are also investigating autism subtypes in order to determine whether our results are consistent with the data obtained by other researchers who are studying brain structure, immune system, gastrointestinal problems, biomarkers, and more.</p>
                  <p>Instructions.  The questionnaire should be completed by a parent or guardian who has one or more children on the autism spectrum.   In addition, your son/daughter needs to be at least three years of age and formally diagnosed with autism, Asperger’s syndrome, or pervasive developmental disorder (PDD). </p>
                  <p>Once the data is collected and analyzed, we will contact those who completed the questionnaire and send them a summary report of the findings. </p>
                  <p>We have received approval from Liberty IRB, Inc., a federally-approved Institutional Review Committee.  Please read the confidentiality statement carefully, which is located at the beginning of the questionnaire.  If you agree to the statement, please check the appropriate box; you will then be able to complete the questionnaire.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here are some specific instructions:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>If a question asks about something that happened a long time ago and you don’t remember, please do not guess.  You should simply indicate that you don’t know. </li>
                    <li> Since some people may enter nonsensical data into the online questionnaire, we have programmed the website to send you an email after you have entered your responses.  Please click on the link in the email to verify your email address.  Otherwise, we will not be able to use the data in our analyses. </li>
                    <li>The questionnaire involves several parts, and we estimate that it will take from one to two hours to answer all of the questions.  You may complete the questionnaire during more than one session.  In this case, a link will be included in the email sent to you.  You simply need to click the link to return to the questionnaire.  If you accidentally delete the email, you can request another email with the link from the questionnaire’s webpage, www.AutismResearchSurvey.com<br>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Please let us know if you have any specific questions about the study and/or the questionnaire.</p>
                  <p>Thank you in advance.<br>
